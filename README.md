## Inspiration ðŸ§ 
People around the world are becoming less careful about recycling, including not knowing when to throw out trash and understanding what composting involves. This neglect is harmful to the environment and worsens the effects of climate change. Proper waste management is essential for reducing pollution, conserving resources, and slowing down global warming. Recycling ensures that materials like plastic, paper, and metal can be reused instead of ending up in landfills. Composting helps reduce harmful gases and turns organic waste into useful soil nutrients. Sorting waste correctly also prevents contamination, making recycling more effective. The need to act is urgent, and we must pay more attention to where our waste goes to help protect the planet.

## Our Project ðŸ’»
We created a project focused on raising awareness about proper waste disposal. Our website includes a homepage with our mission, a resources page with links to information and statistics on waste management, a leaderboard showcasing individuals who have managed their waste correctly, and a game where users catch the correct waste items in the recycling bin. We want to make learning about waste disposal fun and engaging.

## How We Built the Project & Challenges ðŸ”¨
We built the project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At first, we faced challenges figuring out how to avoid merge conflicts when committing changes to the repository in GitHub. We also had issues with the game, where the catcher didn't always catch the falling objects. After some late-night debugging, we realized the problem was with how we checked a specific collision area of the catcher. We also made adjustments to ensure that ties on the leaderboard were handled correctly by using different conditional statements.

## What's Next ðŸ”®
Looking ahead, we plan to improve the game by using images of items like paper and apples, increasing the variety and frequency of falling objects, and allowing users to choose different catcher options, such as a trash can, compost bin, or recycling bin. We also want to add a game-ending condition where the player loses if their score drops to zero, and we also want to include a podium for the current three highest scorers.
